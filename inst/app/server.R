# -------- #

# DESC: Code here can be much longer and complicated than in ui.R.
#       Is where all the dynamic data manipulation happens, and plot creations.
#       e.g. Filtering based on user inputs and generating plots based on
#            dynamically filtered data.
#       server.R must create a function called server, like below:

server <- function(input, output, session) {

}
