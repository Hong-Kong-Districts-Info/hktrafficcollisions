Hong Kong Traffic Injury Collision Database is a project co-developed by Street Reset and Hong Kong District Info, which aims to visualise Hong Kong traffic collision data with interactive mapping. Our objective is three-fold:

-   To alert the public on the current severity of traffic collisions in Hong Kong, with particular dire implications for pedestrians and cyclists,
-   To draw attention to how street design has contributed to the current situation, and what systemic remedies should be made to enhance the safety of vulnerable road users, and
-   To provide journalists, district councillors, and government departments with insights and map-based data evidence to understand this issue.
