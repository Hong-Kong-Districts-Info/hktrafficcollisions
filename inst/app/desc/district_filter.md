This filter refers to the area/district you are interested to look into.

Type in the names of the district, then click on the name of the desired district to include collision in that district to the map. Autocomplete function is also available.

Due to the limitation of server load, you can only choose **3 districts at most** at one time (We know, it's not ideal).
