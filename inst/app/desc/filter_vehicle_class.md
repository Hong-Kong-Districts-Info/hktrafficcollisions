**涉事車輛類別**代表該宗車禍牽涉的車輛種類。如剔選多於一種車輛類別，資料庫會篩選及顯示包含已選擇種類中**任何**一種車輛之車禍，而非包含已剔選種類中**所有**種類車輛之車禍。

例如，當你剔選「的士」及「輕型貨車」車輛類別時，只要該宗車禍牽涉的士或輕型貨車，該宗車禍便會顯示於地圖上。

**Vehicle classes** involved in the collision refers to the which type of vehicles are involved in the collision. Note that checking multiple boxes means to filter collisions including ANY of the selected vehicle classes, instead of ALL selected classes.

For example, when both *Taxi* and *Light goods vehicle* boxes are selected, any collisions involving taxis or light good vehicles are shown.
