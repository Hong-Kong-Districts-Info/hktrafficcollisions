Vehicle classes involved in the collision refers to the which type of vehicles are involved in the collision.

Note that checking multiple boxes means to filter collisions including ANY of the selected vehicle classes, instead of ALL selected classes. For example, when both *Taxi* and *Light goods vehicle* boxes are selected, any collisions involving taxis or light good vehicles are shown.
